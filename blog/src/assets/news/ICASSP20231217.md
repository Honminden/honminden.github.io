# HD Map construction paper accepted in ICASSP 2024

Our paper *BUFFERED GAUSSIAN MODELING FOR VECTORIZED HD MAP CONSTRUCTION* is accepted in [ICASSP 2024](https://2024.ieeeicassp.org/).

In this paper, we define a geometric-aware metric for HD Map construction with Minkowski sum, and propose a novel method, namely Buffered Gaussian Modeling, to improve model optimization for vectorized map elements.

The paper will be available when published by ICASSP Comittee. Please refer to their official website for the date.
